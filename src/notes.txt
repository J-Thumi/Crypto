if you want to initialise an empty react app in the cuurrent directory use npx create-raect-app ./
 to get more components of ant design get to antDesign .com components



 instead of importing all components independently in app.js yo can create an index.js in the components folder then import them there 
        import {default as Navbar} from './Navbar'
 then in the app.js import all from there in one line
        import {Navbar,Layout,Footer} from './components'
